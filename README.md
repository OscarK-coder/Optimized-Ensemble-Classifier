# Ensemble-Classifier-Dengue-Prediction-Classification

## Technologies Used
- Python: Core programming language.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning models.
- Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
- XGBoost: For gradient boosting models.
- Streamlit: For creating an interactive user interface.

## System Architecture
- Data Preprocessing: Handles cleaning, normalization, and feature selection.
- Prediction Engine: Combines multiple classifiers (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.) to enhance accuracy.
- Recommendation System: Generates advice based on prediction outcomes.

## Testing and Results
- Cross-validation: Performed using K-Fold cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
- Performance Metrics: Models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.

## Key Results:
-- Best Model: Ensemble classifier achieved an accuracy of 91.9%.
-- Feature Importance: Highlighted key symptoms contributing to accurate predictions

## Future Scope
Real-Time Data Integration: Incorporating real-time data to enhance prediction accuracy.
Mobile Application: Developing a mobile-friendly version for wider accessibility.
Additional Features: Expanding the system to include preventive recommendations.
